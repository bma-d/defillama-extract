## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 2)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity
- ✓ Learnings subsection present and cites prior story plus file list and open items [lines 136-141]. Evidence: "### Learnings from Previous Story" with bullet referencing 5.3 files and unresolved items.
- Observation (Minor): Statement says unresolved review items remain open, but prior story shows all follow-ups checked [prev story lines 148-156]. Consider correcting to avoid confusion.

### Source Document Coverage
- ✓ Story cites epic, tech spec, and PRD in Source line [13].
- ✓ Architecture/testing references present in Dev Notes with anchors [99-103, 142-144, 163-170].

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
- ✓ 4 ACs present, testable, trace to epic/tech spec (matches tech-spec-epic-5.md table at lines 409-416).

### Task–AC Mapping
- ✓ Tasks reference ACs; each AC covered by Tasks 1-3; testing subtasks present in Tasks 4-5 [48-85].

### Dev Notes Quality
- ✓ Required subsections present (Architecture patterns, Learnings, Testing guidance, References) [99-170].
- ⚠ Minor: Expected data volume/date range stated (~1,466 points, 2021-11-29 start) without explicit citation [131-134]; add source link (e.g., seed doc line 28 or API evidence).

### Story Structure
- ✓ Status = drafted [3]; Story uses As/I want/So that [7-9].
- ✓ Dev Agent Record sections initialized [172-192]; Change Log initialized [194-198].

### Unresolved Review Items
- ✓ No unchecked items found in previous story (all review follow-ups checked [prev story 148-156]). No critical continuity gaps.

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
- None.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
- None.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- Clarify Learnings: current story claims unresolved review items remain, but prior story shows them completed; adjust wording for accuracy.
- Add citation for chart data volume/date-range figures (~1,466 points, 2021-11-29 start) to avoid unverified specifics.

## Successes
- ACs match epic/tech-spec exactly and are fully enumerated.
- Tasks map cleanly to ACs with testing subtasks included.
- Dev Notes include architecture/testing references and prior-story learnings, satisfying continuity expectations.
