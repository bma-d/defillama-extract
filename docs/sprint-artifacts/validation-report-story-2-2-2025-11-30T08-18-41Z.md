## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 0)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Dev Agent Record
Pass Rate: 0/1 (0%)

✗ FAIL Dev Agent Record sections are present but empty (Context Reference, Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List). These are required to be populated for a drafted story. Evidence: lines 182-197 show placeholders with no content and an empty file list. Impact: Lacks execution traceability and handoff details for developers and reviewers.

## Failed Items
- Dev Agent Record missing required populated fields; add Context Reference (story context XML), Agent Model Used, Debug Log references, completion notes, and file list entries to restore traceability.

## Partial Items
- None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Fill in all Dev Agent Record subsections with actual values (context XML path, model used, debug log links, completion notes, file list).
2. Should Improve: N/A
3. Consider: N/A
