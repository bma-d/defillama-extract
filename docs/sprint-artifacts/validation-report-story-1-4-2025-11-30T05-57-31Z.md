- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity
- ✓ Previous story 1-3 status is done; continuity section present with learnings and reference to prior story (lines 188-206). Evidence: sprint-status.yaml lines 40-43; story lines 188-206.
- ✓ Learnings now list files added/modified in Story 1-3 (config.go, config_test.go, sprint-status.yaml, story 1-3 doc). Evidence: lines 197-205.

### Source Document Coverage
- ✓ Tech spec cited (tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC7/#AC8/#AC9) lines 202-204.
- ✓ Architecture guidance cited (ADR-004, consistency-rules, testing-strategy) lines 206-209.
- ✓ Epic reference anchor corrected to `#story-14-implement-structured-logging-with-slog`. Evidence: line 205.
- ✓ PRD reference anchor corrected to `#logging`. Evidence: line 206.

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
- ✓ 7 ACs present, align with epic and tech spec coverage (lines 13-25; epic lines 113-137; tech spec AC7-AC9).

### Task-AC Mapping & Testing
- ✓ Each AC referenced by at least one task; testing subtasks provided (Task 3) covering AC1-5; AC6-7 covered by Tasks 1-2/4.

### Dev Notes Quality
- ✓ Required subsections present (Technical Guidance, Project Structure Notes, Learnings, References) with citations.

### Story Structure
- ✓ Status drafted (line 3); story statement uses As a / I want / so that format (lines 7-9).
- ✓ Dev Agent Record sections present (lines 211-225); Change Log initialized (lines 227-231).

### Unresolved Review Items
- ✓ Previous story review shows no open action items (story 1-3 lines 216-274); none to carry forward.

## Failed Items
- None.

## Partial Items
- None.

## Recommendations
- Ready for story-context generation and handoff.

## Successes
- ACs align with epic/tech-spec expectations and cover structured logging behaviors.
- Tasks map cleanly to ACs with dedicated testing tasks.
- Dev Notes include project structure and testing guidance with architectural references.
