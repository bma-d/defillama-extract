## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 1)
- Coverage: All checklist sections reviewed; no skipped items
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity
- ✓ Learnings section present with prior story references and file carry-overs (lines 136-143, 136-140).
- ⚠ Minor: Story lists two "open" review items from Story 5.3 even though all review items are marked complete there, creating confusion about outstanding work (current story lines 141-143 vs prior story lines 148-156 showing all [x]).

### Source Document Coverage
- ✓ Story cites epics, tech spec, and PRD with anchors (line 13).
- ✓ Architecture/ADR/testing sources cited in Dev Notes (lines 99-103, 132-134, 145-147, 170-173).
- ➖ N/A: coding-standards.md / unified-project-structure.md not present in repo; no issue.

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
- ✓ Four ACs match tech spec/epic content; each is testable and atomic (lines 15-44; tech-spec section 5.4.1–5.4.4).

### Task–AC Mapping
- ✓ Every AC has mapped tasks; each task tags ACs and includes testing subtasks (lines 46-85).

### Dev Notes Quality
- ✓ Architecture guidance is specific and cited (lines 99-103).
- ✓ References subsection lists multiple sources with paths+anchors (lines 164-173).
- ✓ Learnings captured; testing guidance aligns with testing strategy doc (lines 136-148).

### Story Structure & Metadata
- ✓ Status is "drafted" (line 3).
- ✓ Story statement follows As a / I want / So that format (lines 7-9).
- ✓ Dev Agent Record sections initialized (lines 175-195).
- ✓ Change Log initialized (lines 197-201).
- ✓ File located under docs/sprint-artifacts with key 5-4 (path confirmed).

### Unresolved Review Items Alert
- ✓ Prior story has no unchecked review items (prior story lines 148-156 all [x]).
- ⚠ Minor: Current story lists two open review items that were already closed in 5.3; align with prior record to avoid redundant work.

## Recommendations
1. Update "Learnings from Previous Story" to reflect that Story 5.3 review items are already closed; remove or mark them as addressed.
2. Keep the rest as-is; no critical or major gaps found.
