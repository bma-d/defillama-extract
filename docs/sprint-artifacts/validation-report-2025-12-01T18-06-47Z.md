## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (0 Critical, 2 Major, 0 Minor)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Continuity & Sources
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
- ✓ Previous story continuity captured with learnings and source link [Evidence: lines 168-183]
- ✓ Tech spec and epic cited in AC sources [Evidence: lines 13-14]
- ✓ Architecture & testing references listed [Evidence: lines 215-223]
- ✓ Tasks include testing subtasks [Evidence: lines 101-110]
- ✓ Change Log initialized [Evidence: lines 241-245]

### Acceptance Criteria & Tasks
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Four ACs present and match tech-spec mapping [Evidence: lines 15-58; tech-spec 5.1 table]
- ✓ Tasks map to ACs and include testing coverage [Evidence: lines 62-110]

### Dev Notes Quality
Pass Rate: 4/5 (80%)
- ✓ Architecture guidance and atomic write pattern included with citation [Evidence: lines 125-163]
- ✓ Project structure notes present [Evidence: lines 184-193]
- ✓ Testing standards present [Evidence: lines 194-199]
- ✓ References section populated with specific sources [Evidence: lines 213-223]
- ✗ Dev Agent Record missing required content fields (Agent Model, Debug Log, Completion Notes, File List are empty) [Evidence: lines 231-240]

### Story Structure
Pass Rate: 3/4 (75%)
- ✓ Story statement uses As a / I want / so that format [Evidence: lines 5-9]
- ✓ File located in correct stories folder
- ✓ Change Log exists [Evidence: lines 241-245]
- ✗ Status should be "drafted" for validation stage but is "ready-for-dev" [Evidence: line 3]

## Failed Items
- Status not "drafted" during validation; set to drafted until context generation completes. [Evidence: line 3]
- Dev Agent Record sections empty (Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List). Populate with model/version, key debug links, concise completion notes, and files touched. [Evidence: lines 231-240]

## Partial Items
- None

## Recommendations
1. Update Status to "drafted" until story context validation is finished, then advance to ready-for-dev.
2. Fill Dev Agent Record: set Agent Model Used, add debug log references, list completion notes (key decisions), and enumerate files expected to change.

## Successes
- Continuity to previous story documented with reusable patterns and file references.
- ACs tightly sourced from tech spec and epic with clear tasks and testing coverage.
- Dev Notes include atomic write pattern and architecture/testing references, giving developers actionable guidance.
