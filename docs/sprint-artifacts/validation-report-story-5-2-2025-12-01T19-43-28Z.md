# Validation Report

**Document:** docs/sprint-artifacts/5-2-implement-cli-and-single-run-mode.md  
**Checklist:** .bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/checklist.md  
**Date:** 2025-12-01T19-43-28Z

## Summary
- Overall: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 1, Minor: 0)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity
- PASS – Previous story 5-1 marked done in sprint status and Learnings section references its outputs and files. Evidence: sprint-status lines 79-83; story lines 213-235.

### Source Document Coverage
- PASS – Story cites tech spec, epic, PRD, ADRs, testing strategy; all referenced files exist. Evidence: story lines 13, 264-272.

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
- PASS – 14 ACs present, testable, and trace to tech spec Story 5.2. Evidence: story lines 15-102; tech-spec-epic-5.md lines 96-152.

### Task-AC Mapping
- PASS – Tasks reference ACs and include testing subtasks. Evidence: story lines 105-166.

### Dev Notes Quality
- PASS – Contains technical guidance, learnings with citations, project structure notes, testing standards, and smoke tests. Evidence: story lines 171-260.

### Story Structure & Metadata
- MAJOR – Dev Agent Record is uninitialized (Context Reference placeholder, agent model placeholder, Debug Log, Completion Notes, File List empty). Evidence: story lines 274-289.

## Failed Items
- **Dev Agent Record missing content** (Context Reference, Agent Model, Debug Log, Completion Notes, File List) → add actual entries after drafting or execution. Evidence: story lines 274-289.

## Recommendations
1. Populate Dev Agent Record: fill Context Reference with story context XML path, record agent model, add debug commands run, completion notes, and file list once implementation begins.
2. After updating, re-run validation to confirm zero issues.
