# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 3-2-extract-protocol-metadata-and-tvs-data - Extract Protocol Metadata and TVS Data
Outcome: PASS (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 0)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
- None.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
- None.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- None.

## Successes
- Previous-story continuity captured in Dev Notes via "Learnings from Previous Story" with citation to Story 3.1; no unresolved review items found.
- Source documents cited with anchors: PRD FR11/FR12/FR14, epic story section, architecture data-architecture API response models, testing-strategy Go conventions, and fr-category-to-architecture mapping.
- Acceptance Criteria are specific, testable, and trace directly to epic/PRD sources; zero missing ACs.
- Tasks map to all ACs and include testing subtasks; testing standards explicitly referenced in Dev Notes.
- Dev Notes provide architecture/data guidance and testing expectations; includes OraclesTVS/Chart structures and implementation pattern.
- Dev Agent Record sections populated (context noted as not yet generated, agent model noted, completion notes, file list) and Change Log initialized.
- Story status is "drafted" with correct As a / I want / so that format; file path matches sprint-status tracking location.

## Evidence
- Continuity: Dev Notes "Learnings from Previous Story" referencing Story 3.1 (lines ~184-195).
- Testing reference added: Dev Notes > Testing Standards citing docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md.
- Anchored references list includes PRD FR11/FR12/FR14 and architecture/testing documents (References section lines ~197-205).
- Acceptance Criteria (6 items) align to epic/PRD (lines 15-25).
- Tasks with AC mapping and testing subtasks (lines 29-60, 47-55).
- Dev Agent Record populated (lines 206-222) and Change Log present (lines 224-226).

## Recommendations
- Ready for story-context generation and developer handoff.
