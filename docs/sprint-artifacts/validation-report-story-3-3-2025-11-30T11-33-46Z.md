### 2) Previous Story Continuity
✓ PASS — Previous story 3-2 is status done with review approved/no action items (docs/sprint-artifacts/3-2-extract-protocol-metadata-and-tvs-data.md lines 1-4, 237-245). Current story includes Learnings citing prior story and key takeaways (lines 161-171) with explicit source link.
